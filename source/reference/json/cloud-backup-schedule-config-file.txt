You can use a cloud backup schedule configuration file to specify the
settings required when you `update a cloud backup schedule
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/stable/command/atlas-backups-schedule-update/>`__
using the {+atlas-cli+}. The {+atlas-cli+} accepts ``.json`` cloud
backup schedule configuration files.

Cloud Backup Schedule Settings
------------------------------

You can specify the following settings to update a cloud
backup schedule either in the configuration file or as flags in the
command:

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1 
   :widths: 20 10 70 

   * - Field 
     - Type 
     - Description 

   * - ``autoExportEnabled``
     - boolean
     - Flag that indicates whether |service| automatically exports
       cloud backup snapshots to the |aws| bucket.

   * - ``copySettings``
     - array
     - List that contains a document for each copy setting item in the
       desired backup policy.

   * - | ``copySettings.``
       | ``cloudProvider``
     - string
     - Human-readable label that identifies the cloud provider that
       stores the snapshot copy.

   * - | ``copySettings.``
       | ``frequencies``
     - array of strings
     - List that describes which types of snapshots to copy.

   * - | ``copySettings.``
       | ``regionName``
     - string
     - Target Atlas region to copy snapshots belonging to ``replicationSpecId``

       <microsoft-azure>` region.

   * - | ``copySettings.``
       | ``replicationSpecId``
     - string
     - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies the
       replication object for a zone in a cluster. For global clusters,
       there can be multiple zones to choose from. For sharded clusters
       and replica set clusters, there is only one zone in the cluster.
       To find ``thereplicationSpecId``, do a GET request to
       :oas-atlas-op:`Return One Cluster in One Project
       </getLegacyCluster>` and consult its ``replicationSpecs`` array.

   * - | ``copySettings.``
       | ``shouldCopyOplogs``
     - boolean
     - Flag that indicates whether to copy the oplogs to the target
       region. You can use the oplogs to perform point-in-time restores.

   * - ``deleteCopiedBackups``
     - array
     - List that contains a document for each copy setting item in the
       desired backup policy.

   * - | ``deleteCopiedBackups.``
       | ``cloudProvider``
     - string
     - Human-readable label that identifies the cloud provider for the
       deleted copy setting whose backup copies you want to delete.

   * - | ``deleteCopiedBackups.``
       | ``regionName``
     - string
     - Target Atlas region to copy snapshots belonging to ``replicationSpecId``
       to. Please supply the **Atlas Region** that corresponds to your
       :ref:`AWS <amazon-aws>`, :ref:`GCP <google-gcp>` or :ref:`Azure
       <microsoft-azure>` region.

   * - | ``deleteCopiedBackups.``
       | ``replicationSpecId``
     - string
     - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies the
       replication object for a zone in a cluster. For global clusters,
       there can be multiple zones to choose from. For sharded clusters
       and replica setclusters, there is only one zone in the cluster.
       To find ``thereplicationSpecId``, do a GET request to
       :oas-atlas-op:`Return One Cluster in One Project
       </getLegacyCluster>` and consult its ``replicationSpecs`` array.

   * - ``export``
     - object
     - List that contains a document for each copy setting item in the
       desired backup policy.

   * - | ``export.``
       | ``exportBucketId``
     - string
     - Unique 24-hexadecimal character string that identifies the |aws|
       Bucket.

   * - | ``export.``
       | ``frequencyType``
     - string
     - Human-readable label that indicates the rate at which the export
       policy item occurs.

   * - ``policies``
     - array
     - Rules set for this backup schedule.

   * - | ``policies.``
       | ``id``
     - string
     - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies this backup
       policy.

   * - | ``policies.``
       | ``policyItems``
     - array
     - List that contains the specifications for one policy.

   * - | ``policies.``
       | ``policyItems.``
       | ``frequencyInterval``
     - integer
     - Number that indicates the frequency interval for a set of
       snapshots. A value of ``1`` specifies the first instance of the
       corresponding ``frequencyType``.

       - In a monthly policy item, ``1`` indicates that the monthly
         snapshot occurs on the first day of the month and ``40``
         indicates the last day of the month.

       - In a weekly policy item, ``1`` indicates that the weekly
         snapshot occurs on Monday and ``7`` indicates Sunday.

       - In an hourly policy item, you can set the frequency interval to
         ``1``, ``2``, ``4``, ``6``, ``8``, or ``12``. For hourly policy
         items for NVMe clusters, |service| only accepts ``12`` as
         the frequency interval value.

   * - | ``policies.``
       | ``policyItems.``
       | ``frequencyType``
     - string
     - Human-readable label that identifies the frequency type
       associated with the backup policy.

   * - | ``policies.``
       | ``policyItems.``
       | ``retentionUnit``
     - string
     - Unit of time in which |service| measures snapshot retention.

   * - | ``policies.``
       | ``policyItems.``
       | ``retentionValue``
     - integer
     - Duration in days, weeks, or months that |service| retains the
       snapshot. For less frequent policy items, |service| requires
       that you specify a value greater than or equal to the value
       specified for more frequent policy items. 

       For example: If the hourly policy item specifies a retention of two
       days, you must specify two days or greater for the retention of the
       weekly policy item. 

   * - ``referenceHourOfDay``
     - integer
     - Hour of day in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) that represents
       when |service| takes the snapshot.

   * - ``referenceMinuteOfHour``
     - integer
     - Minute of the ``referenceHourOfDay`` that represents when
       |service| takes the snapshot.

   * - ``restoreWindowDays``
     - integer
     - Number of previous days that you can restore back to with
       continuous cloud backup accuracy. You must specify a positive,
       non-zero integer. This parameter applies to continuous cloud
       backups only.

   * - ``updateSnapshots``
     - boolean
     - Flag that indicates whether to apply the retention changes in the
       updated backup policy to snapshots that |service| took
       previously.

   * - ``useOrgAndGroupNamesInExportPrefix``
     - boolean
     - Flag that indicates whether to use organization and project names
       instead of organization and project UUIDs in the path to the
       metadata files that |service| uploads to your |aws| bucket.
